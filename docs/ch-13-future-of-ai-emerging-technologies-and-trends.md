In such cases, human expertise in feature engineering and model design may still outperform automated solutions.
  - Risk of over-reliance on automated systems: There's a danger that users might blindly trust AutoML results without critically evaluating the models or understanding their limitations. This can lead to the deployment of models that are not suitable for the specific business context or that have unintended biases.
  - Need for domain expertise in problem formulation: While AutoML can automate many aspects of model development, it still requires human input to properly define the problem, select appropriate data, and interpret results in the context of the business or research question. Misspecification of the problem can lead to irrelevant or misleading models.
  - Limited explainability: Some AutoML systems produce complex models or ensembles that can be difficult to interpret. This lack of transparency can be problematic in regulated industries or in applications where understanding the model's decision-making process is crucial.
  - Computational intensity: Comprehensive AutoML processes, especially those involving extensive hyperparameter tuning and ensemble creation, can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, potentially limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments.
  - Data quality dependency: AutoML systems are highly dependent on the quality and representativeness of the input data. They may not always detect or adequately handle issues like data bias, class imbalance, or outliers, potentially leading to flawed models if these issues are not addressed manually.
