In addition, we rely heavily on intuition and experience, which can be valuable in certain situations but can also lead to blind spots and flawed judgments.

Here are a few key limitations of human decision-making:

* **Cognitive Biases:** Our brains are wired with cognitive biases, mental shortcuts that help us process information quickly but can also lead to systematic errors in judgment. For example, confirmation bias leads us to seek out information that confirms our existing beliefs, while anchoring bias causes us to overemphasize the first piece of information we receive, even if it's irrelevant.
* **Emotional Influences:** Our emotions can significantly impact our decisions, often leading us to make choices that are not in our best interests. For example, fear can lead to risk aversion, while excitement can lead to impulsive decisions.
* **Information Overload:** In the digital age, we are bombarded with information from a multitude of sources, making it difficult to filter out noise and focus on the most relevant data. This information overload can lead to decision fatigue, where our ability to make sound judgments deteriorates after prolonged exposure to complex information.
