# Chapter 6 | Problem-Solution AI (PSAI) Framework

The Problem-Solution AI Framework (PSAI) is a structured approach that breaks down the Google Ventures Design Sprint methodology - among other Design Thinking solutions - into three key steps: problem definition, solution envisioning, and Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development. This chapter provides an in-depth explanation of the PSAI Framework, offering practical guidance and examples for applying it to solve real-world business challenges.

## Understanding the PSAI Framework

The PSAI Framework is designed to guide organizations through the process of developing impactful AI solutions. It begins with a robust problem definition phase to ensure a clear understanding of the challenge at hand. This is followed by solution envisioning, where a range of potential AI solutions are explored to address the defined problem. Finally, the framework emphasizes the development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as a starting point for iterative development and testing.

## Step 1: Problem Definition

The inaugural phase of the PSAI is unequivocally the cornerstone of the entire framework: defining the problem. This stage is both analytical and reflective, as it requires an understanding of the current state and a vision for the desired future. It encompasses:

- **Goal Setting and Success Measurement**: What does success look like? Establish clear, quantifiable goals, and identify key metrics that will be used to measure success, thereby setting expectations, and providing a target. Simply put - are you trying to increase revenue or decrease expenses – then determine the criteria for success.

- **Problem Identification and Articulation**: Begin by identifying the business challenge, engaging with stakeholders across all levels to understand the nuances of the issue, and articulating the problem in precise, measurable terms, ensuring buy-in from all parties involved. The more clearly the problem can be stated, described, and empathized with – the clearer the solution will become.

- **Benchmarking and Best Practices Review**: Conduct a review of internal benchmarks and industry best practices. Learn from the successes and failures of similar initiatives both within and outside the organization to fortify the approach. If creating an innovative solution, you may need to look outside your industry or speak with interdisciplinary experts.

- **Current State Analysis and Process Mapping**: Analyze and document the current process in detail, pinpoint inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas ripe for improvement that AI could potentially address. Create a process map for clear visualization and understanding. At MPR, we use a process called "Monkey-Braining" which reduces the problems to steps extremely simply.

## Step 2: Solution Envisioning

Having a clear understanding of the problem sets the stage for envisioning potential solutions. This brainstorming phase looks at the issue from multiple angles and with innovation at the forefront. This should be performed by a team of diverse experts and people passionate about their fields. The solution envisioning process involves:

- **Generation of AI Solution Candidates**: Develop a comprehensive list of potential AI-driven solutions. Leverage insights from the problem definition phase to ideate how AI can tackle the business challenge from different perspectives. Not every solution requires AI but leveraging AI is core to many current product development projects – thus determining whether a solution should leverage AI is critical at this stage.

- **Feasibility Analysis and Prioritization**: Evaluate each potential solution for technical and economic feasibility. Prioritize solutions based on parameters such as impact, resource requirements, risks, and alignment with business objectives. The answer may be not right now or we're waiting until "X" occurs and then reconvene the team.

- **Prototyping and Early Testing**: Create low-fidelity prototypes or conceptual models for the most promising solutions. Engage in early testing to gather quick feedback and iterate on conceptual designs. This may include human-in-the-loop initially to get a workable prototype.

- **Data Strategy Development**: Data is the lifeblood of your business and AI. Develop a comprehensive data strategy that encompasses data collection, data processing, quality, governance, and security. Preparation of your data for acquisition and preprocessing will promote high-quality inputs for AI output.

## Step 3: MVP Development

The transition from ideation to creation takes place in this critical phase. Developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) allows for testing in a real-world environment, learning, and progressive refining. Key actions include:

- **Solution Architecture Design**: Design the architecture of the AI solution with scalability, stability, and integration in mind. Choose the right technologies, platforms, and AI models that align with the desired outcome.

- **Agile Development Sprints**: Embrace agile development practices that enable rapid iterations of the MVP. Employ sprints to develop, test, and refine the product in manageable increments, using stakeholder feedback to enhance the solution.

- **Performance Metrics and Testing**: Develop a robust testing framework that evaluates the MVP against predefined performance metrics derived from the goals established in Step 1. Measure, analyze, and iterate to meet or exceed these benchmarks.

- **Deployment Strategy and Scaling Plan**: Prepare a deployment strategy for the MVP, considering both technical and organizational readiness. Develop a plan for scaling the solution, gradually integrating it deeper into the business processes as it proves its value and utility.

By embracing the PSAI Framework, businesses are equipped with a robust, structured approach to navigate the complexities of AI implementation. This ensures that AI solutions not only address the right problems with precision but also integrate seamlessly into the business ecosystem, driving measurable value and fostering continuous improvement.
