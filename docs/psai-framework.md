# Problem-Solution AI (PSAI) Framework

The Problem-Solution AI Framework (PSAI) is a structured approach that breaks down the Google Ventures Design Sprint methodology - among other Design Thinking solutions - into three key steps: problem definition, solution envisioning, and Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development. This section provides an in-depth explanation of the PSAI Framework, offering practical guidance and examples for applying it to solve real-world business challenges.

## Understanding the PSAI Framework

The PSAI Framework is designed to guide organizations through the process of developing impactful AI solutions. It begins with a robust problem definition phase to ensure a clear understanding of the challenge at hand. This is followed by solution envisioning, where a range of potential AI solutions are explored to address the defined problem. Finally, the framework emphasizes the development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as a starting point for iterative development and testing.

The PSAI Framework is not just a theoretical construct; it's a practical, hands-on approach that has been refined through real-world application across various industries. It draws inspiration from established methodologies like Design Thinking and Agile development, but tailors these concepts specifically for AI implementation. This framework recognizes that AI projects often involve unique challenges, such as data quality issues, ethical considerations, and the need for specialized expertise.

By following the PSAI Framework, organizations can avoid common pitfalls in AI implementation, such as developing solutions in search of problems or getting bogged down in technical details before fully understanding the business need. Instead, it promotes a holistic, user-centered approach that aligns AI capabilities with genuine business value.

## Step 1: Problem Definition

The inaugural phase of the PSAI is unequivocally the cornerstone of the entire framework: defining the problem. This stage is both analytical and reflective, as it requires an understanding of the current state and a vision for the desired future. It encompasses:

- **Goal Setting and Success Measurement**: What does success look like? Establish clear, quantifiable goals, and identify key metrics that will be used to measure success, thereby setting expectations, and providing a target. Simply put - are you trying to increase revenue or decrease expenses – then determine the criteria for success. This step involves deep collaboration with stakeholders to ensure alignment on what constitutes success. It might involve workshops, surveys, or one-on-one interviews to gather diverse perspectives. For example, a retail company might set a goal of reducing customer churn by 15% within six months using AI-driven personalization.

- **Problem Identification and Articulation**: Begin by identifying the business challenge, engaging with stakeholders across all levels to understand the nuances of the issue, and articulating the problem in precise, measurable terms, ensuring buy-in from all parties involved. The more clearly the problem can be stated, described, and empathized with – the clearer the solution will become. This step often involves techniques like root cause analysis, customer journey mapping, or the "5 Whys" method to dig deeper into the underlying issues. For instance, a manufacturing company might initially think their problem is low productivity, but through this process, they might discover that the real issue is inefficient inventory management.

- **Benchmarking and Best Practices Review**: Conduct a review of internal benchmarks and industry best practices. Learn from the successes and failures of similar initiatives both within and outside the organization to fortify the approach. If creating an innovative solution, you may need to look outside your industry or speak with interdisciplinary experts. This could involve attending industry conferences, conducting literature reviews, or engaging in peer networking. For example, a healthcare provider looking to implement AI for patient diagnosis might study how AI is used in financial fraud detection for insights on pattern recognition in complex datasets.

- **Current State Analysis and Process Mapping**: Analyze and document the current process in detail, pinpoint inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas ripe for improvement that AI could potentially address. Create a process map for clear visualization and understanding. At MPR, we use a process called "Monkey-Braining" which reduces the problems to steps extremely simply. This might involve creating detailed flowcharts, conducting time-and-motion studies, or using process mining tools to analyze system logs. For instance, an e-commerce company might map out their entire order fulfillment process, from the moment a customer places an order to when it's delivered, identifying steps where AI could streamline operations.

Throughout this problem definition phase, it's crucial to maintain open communication channels and foster a culture of curiosity and honesty. Encourage team members to challenge assumptions and bring forward unconventional ideas. This phase might also involve preliminary data analysis to validate assumptions and provide quantitative backing to qualitative insights.

## Step 2: Solution Envisioning

Having a clear understanding of the problem sets the stage for envisioning potential solutions. This brainstorming phase looks at the issue from multiple angles and with innovation at the forefront. This should be performed by a team of diverse experts and people passionate about their fields. The solution envisioning process involves:

- **Generation of AI Solution Candidates**: Develop a comprehensive list of potential AI-driven solutions. Leverage insights from the problem definition phase to ideate how AI can tackle the business challenge from different perspectives. Not every solution requires AI but leveraging AI is core to many current product development projects – thus determining whether a solution should leverage AI is critical at this stage. This step often involves creative brainstorming techniques like mind mapping, SCAMPER (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse), or design thinking workshops. For example, a logistics company might generate ideas ranging from AI-powered route optimization to predictive maintenance for vehicles.

- **Feasibility Analysis and Prioritization**: Evaluate each potential solution for technical and economic feasibility. Prioritize solutions based on parameters such as impact, resource requirements, risks, and alignment with business objectives. The answer may be not right now or we're waiting until "X" occurs and then reconvene the team. This step might involve creating a decision matrix that weighs different factors, conducting preliminary cost-benefit analyses, or using techniques like the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to prioritize features. For instance, a financial services firm might prioritize an AI-driven fraud detection system over a chatbot for customer service based on potential ROI and risk mitigation.

- **Prototyping and Early Testing**: Create low-fidelity prototypes or conceptual models for the most promising solutions. Engage in early testing to gather quick feedback and iterate on conceptual designs. This may include human-in-the-loop initially to get a workable prototype. Prototyping could involve creating wireframes, storyboards, or even simple mock-ups using tools like Figma or Adobe XD. For AI-specific prototypes, this might involve using pre-trained models or AI services to simulate functionality. For example, a healthcare provider might create a basic chatbot using a pre-trained language model to test the concept of AI-assisted patient triage.

- **Data Strategy Development**: Data is the lifeblood of your business and AI. Develop a comprehensive data strategy that encompasses data collection, data processing, quality, governance, and security. Preparation of your data for acquisition and preprocessing will promote high-quality inputs for AI output. This involves auditing existing data sources, identifying data gaps, and planning for data integration. It might also include developing data quality metrics, establishing data governance policies, and planning for data privacy compliance. For instance, a retail company might develop a strategy to integrate point-of-sale data with online browsing behavior to create a unified customer profile for AI-driven personalization.

During this solution envisioning phase, it's important to maintain a balance between creativity and practicality. Encourage wild ideas in the initial stages, but be prepared to critically evaluate them later. Consider forming cross-functional teams to bring diverse perspectives to the ideation process. It's also crucial to involve end-users or their representatives in this phase to ensure that the envisioned solutions truly address their needs and pain points.

## Step 3: MVP Development

The transition from ideation to creation takes place in this critical phase. This is where you develop an AI-based Minimum Viable Product (MVP) allowing for testing in a real-world environment, learning, and progressive refining. Key actions include:

- **Solution Architecture Design**: Design the architecture of the AI solution with scalability, stability, and integration in mind. Choose the right technologies, platforms, and AI models that align with the desired outcome. This step involves making crucial decisions about the tech stack, such as choosing between cloud-based or on-premises solutions, selecting appropriate AI frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), and planning for integration with existing systems. For example, an e-commerce company developing an AI-powered recommendation engine might design a microservices architecture that allows for easy scaling and integration with their existing product catalog and user profile systems.

- **Development Sprints**: Developing AI systems is a rapid process. Many prototypes can be developed within a few days. We recommend embracing agile development practices that enable rapid iterations of the MVP. You should employ sprints to develop, test, and refine the product in manageable increments, using stakeholder feedback to enhance the solution. This involves organizing the development team into cross-functional units, setting up regular sprint planning and review meetings, and using tools like Jira or Trello for project management. For instance, a team developing an AI-driven customer service chatbot might have two week-long sprints, each focusing on a specific capability like handling basic inquiries, integrating with the CRM system, or improving natural language understanding.

- **Performance Metrics and Testing**: Next, develop a robust testing framework that evaluates the MVP against predefined performance metrics derived from the goals established in Step 1. Measure, analyze, and iterate to meet or exceed these benchmarks. This involves setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, implementing automated testing, and establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to AI, such as model accuracy, inference time, or user satisfaction scores. For example, a financial services firm developing an AI-powered fraud detection system might set up A/B testing to compare the new system's performance against their existing rule-based system.

- **Deployment Strategy and Scaling Plan**: Prepare a deployment strategy for the MVP, considering both technical and organizational readiness. Develop a plan for scaling the solution, gradually integrating it deeper into the business processes as it proves its value and utility. This involves planning for infrastructure needs, considering options like containerization for easy deployment and scaling, and developing a rollout strategy that might start with a pilot group before expanding to the entire organization. It also includes planning for ongoing monitoring, maintenance, and updates of the AI system. For instance, a manufacturing company implementing an AI-driven predictive maintenance system might start with a single production line before rolling out to the entire factory, and then to multiple locations.

Throughout the MVP development phase, it's crucial to maintain open lines of communication with stakeholders and end-users. Regular demos and feedback sessions can help ensure that the development stays aligned with business needs. It's also important to consider ethical implications and potential biases in AI systems during this phase, implementing safeguards and monitoring mechanisms as necessary.

By embracing the PSAI Framework, businesses are equipped with a robust, structured approach to navigate the complexities of AI implementation. This ensures that AI solutions not only address the right problems with precision but also integrate seamlessly into the business ecosystem, driving measurable value and fostering continuous improvement. The framework's emphasis on iterative development and continuous learning allows organizations to stay agile in the face of rapidly evolving AI technologies and changing business landscapes.
