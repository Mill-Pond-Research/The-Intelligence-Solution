# Chapter 3 | Understanding Intelligence as a Service

In the data-centric world of modern business, the imperative to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) for competitive advantage is palpable. As organizations grapple with the complexities of big data and the need for sophisticated analytics, Intelligence as a Service (IaaS) has emerged as a compelling paradigm. This innovative approach enables organizations to leapfrog the dilemmas of developing complex AI systems in-house by leveraging external service providers who can rapidly develop and provide cross-industry expertise that support their business's sophisticated AI endeavors.

## Defining Intelligence as a Service

IaaS is best described as outsourcing AI development to an outside firm. It allows companies to leverage state-of-the-art intelligence services without investing in the extensive infrastructure and skilled workforce typically required to develop and maintain such systems. Through a third-party service provider, companies can tap into an array of AI offerings - from machine learning and natural language processing to predictive analytics and beyond. 

As we explore the concept of Intelligence as a Service, it's valuable to examine real-world examples of companies at the forefront of this field. Mill Pond Research, a pioneering firm in the AI solutions space, offers a range of IaaS options that exemplify the potential of this approach. Their core capabilities include:

Mill Pond Research's approach to IaaS is exemplified through their range of solutions, each designed to address different levels of AI adoption and specific business needs:

As most companies are in the early stages of their AI-implementation lifecycles, we begin by offering them our Workbench solution. WorkBench serves as a generative AI workspace, offering access to multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), plugins, and AI agents, making it ideal for organizations in the early stages of exploring AI capabilities by providing a flexible environment for experimentation and learning.

Imagine you're a marketing manager who has discovered a powerful combination of a particular prompt, model, and plugin that significantly improves your team's ability to generate compelling ad copy. You're excited about the potential impact this could have across your organization. 

This is where PowerTool comes in. PowerTool takes your winning AI configuration and transforms it into a custom-built AI agent that can be seamlessly integrated into your company's existing workflows. Now, instead of keeping this game-changing tool to yourself, you can share it with your colleagues in sales, product development, and customer service, allowing them to enhance their own processes with this targeted AI capability. PowerTool essentially democratizes your AI breakthrough, turning your individual discovery into a company-wide asset that can drive efficiency and innovation across multiple departments.

But there's a problem with both Workbench and PowerTool. While the transformative power of AI can be exciting, there is a major risk. Currently most of the best AI models are hosted by organizations that use inputs as training data. For AI tools to truly be transformative, they need to exist solely within an organization's system and not be reliant upon third-party cloud systems. This is where SandBox comes in: designed for organizations requiring high levels of data security and privacy, SandBox is a hybrid private in-house AI solution that powers custom experiences for customers or employees while maintaining strict control over sensitive information. By running models locally within your organization's architecture, you can be ensured that the most important data stays with you.

Finally, once your Sandbox is in place, it's time to pull data in across your web destinations. That's where we've created Decision Engine. This comprehensive end-to-end analytics platform is tailored for B2B lead generation and customer experience optimization. It demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to elevate high-CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) customers to marketing and supplier partners, showcasing the potential of AI in driving business growth. 

As we develop and implement these AI systems for your organization, we don't just deliver technology – we foster a culture of AI literacy and innovation. Our approach involves comprehensive education and training across all teams, creating synergies that significantly enhance your organization's capabilities.

We provide tailored workshops, hands-on training sessions, and ongoing support to ensure that every department understands not just how to use the AI tools, but also how to think strategically about AI's potential in their specific domain. This educational component is crucial for maximizing the value of your AI investments and driving organization-wide innovation.

Our ultimate goal is to empower your organization to become self-sufficient in AI implementation and management. We strongly encourage and support the establishment of your own "Department of Intelligence" – a dedicated team within your organization focused on AI strategy, implementation, and optimization.

This Department of Intelligence would serve as a central hub for AI initiatives, responsible for:

1. Developing and maintaining AI strategy aligned with business objectives
2. Coordinating AI projects across different departments
3. Ensuring ethical AI use and compliance with regulations
4. Continuously exploring new AI technologies and use cases
5. Managing relationships with AI vendors and service providers
6. Providing internal consulting on AI-related matters

By cultivating this internal expertise, your organization can maintain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, ensuring long-term success and innovation. Our role transitions from being your primary AI provider to a strategic partner, offering advanced support and insights as your internal capabilities grow.

Remember, the future belongs to organizations that can effectively harness AI across all aspects of their operations. By replacing external dependencies with internal competencies, you're not just adopting AI – you're becoming an AI-driven organization.

These solutions illustrate the versatility of IaaS offerings, ranging from exploratory tools to highly specialized, security-focused systems. By leveraging such services, businesses can access cutting-edge AI capabilities without the need for extensive in-house expertise or infrastructure investment.

To illustrate this concept, consider the analogy of building and maintaining a car. In this scenario, hiring an IaaS company is akin to commissioning a specialized automotive manufacturer to build your "car" (AI system) according to your specifications. Once the car is built, you then hire mechanics (AI specialists) to keep it running smoothly. This approach allows you to benefit from cutting-edge technology without the need to become an expert in automotive engineering or mechanics yourself.

We see IaaS as the forerunner to what will become a standard Intelligence Department within the business ecosystem. The singular focus of this department will be on the strategic application of AI technologies across all of your organization's divisions. Unlike other business units that may use AI tools in a piecemeal fashion to enhance their specific tasks, a business's Intelligence Department integrates and orchestrates AI initiatives across the company's operations, aligning them with overarching business objectives and the executive's strategy. 

In the near future, we anticipate the emergence of dedicated departments of intelligence in many businesses - particularly those in technology, customer management, marketing, software development, IT solutions, content creation, and analysis. These departments will serve as the central hub for AI strategy, implementation, and optimization, ensuring that the organization remains at the forefront of technological innovation.

## Advantages of AI Services and Platforms

IaaS offers several significant benefits over developing in-house AI capabilities, including:

- **Cost Savings**: Investing in AI infrastructure can be prohibitively expensive, especially for small to medium-sized businesses. IaaS provides access to leading-edge AI capabilities without the hefty initial investments in hardware, software, and talent. For example, building a robust machine learning platform from scratch could cost millions of dollars and take years to develop. With IaaS, companies can access similar capabilities for a fraction of the cost and in a much shorter timeframe.

- **Access to Specialized Expertise**: IaaS providers have a concentrated pool of expertise and offer services fine-tuned through experience with diverse projects across industries. The world of AI is still relatively small – there are only a few experts with more than ten years of experience in the field. Finding people who have worked with or have access to these networks is paramount to your success. IaaS providers often employ these seasoned professionals, giving you indirect access to their wealth of knowledge and experience.

- **Rapid Deployment**: Providers offer ready-to-deploy solutions that can be customized to a business's needs, accelerating the roll-out of AI functionalities. In the fast-paced world of AI, speed is crucial. Someone comfortable with AI should be able to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within a few days. This rapid development cycle, which might sound impossible in the traditional product development world, is becoming increasingly common in the AI space. For instance, an IaaS provider might be able to deploy a custom chatbot for your customer service department in a matter of weeks, whereas building such a system in-house could take months or even years.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**: AI services are built for elasticity, allowing businesses to scale up or down as needed without revamping their own IT infrastructure. This scalability is crucial in today's dynamic business environment. For example, an e-commerce company might need to dramatically scale up its AI-powered recommendation engine during holiday seasons and scale down during slower periods. IaaS solutions can accommodate these fluctuations seamlessly.

However, it's important to note that relying upon a single point of failure, such as an API from a single AI provider, isn't always the best solution. Creating an agnostic-AI environment that accommodates multiple models from multiple providers or hosting your own Large Language Models (LLMs) within the cloud are great solutions depending on your privacy requirements and tolerance for inaccurate results (which may require additional prompting). Every system has tradeoffs, and it's crucial to consult with an IaaS expert to determine which solution is best for your organization.

## Enabling AI Adoption without Extensive Internal Expertise

IaaS levels the playing field, enabling smaller companies or those without significant expertise in AI to access sophisticated analytics and services. This democratization of AI technology is crucial for maintaining competitiveness in today's market. For instance, a small marketing firm can now leverage AI-powered analytics to provide insights that were previously only available to large corporations with extensive data science teams.

Deployment of these solutions through user-friendly interfaces, APIs, and toolkits simplifies AI integration and utilization into daily operations. This ease of use is critical for widespread adoption within an organization. For example, a sales team can easily integrate an AI-powered lead scoring system into their existing CRM without needing to understand the complex algorithms working behind the scenes.

Continuous improvement by providers ensures that the latest in AI advancements are available to businesses, circumventing the need for constant upgradation and mitigating obsolescence. This ongoing evolution of services allows businesses to stay at the cutting edge of AI technology without the need for continuous internal research and development. For instance, as natural language processing models improve, your IaaS-provided chatbot can be updated to understand and respond to customer queries more accurately, without any effort on your part.

In conclusion, as data becomes the currency of the twenty-first century, IaaS is an indispensable tool for businesses of all sizes, democratizing access to AI and providing the agility needed for rapid adaptation and innovation. By leveraging IaaS, companies can focus on their core competencies while still benefiting from the transformative power of AI. As we move forward, the ability to effectively utilize IaaS may well become a key differentiator between companies that thrive and those that struggle in the AI-driven future.
